# Develop

Follow the below steps to develop `Jupyter Manager`.

## Environment

First, you need [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) up-and-running on your machine.

:::caution

You need to develop on macOS or Linux. Windows is not supported as development platform for the time-being.

:::

Clone the `jupyter-manager` repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-manager.git && \
  cd jupyter-manager
```

If you already have created a conda environment, please remove it.

```bash
conda deactivate && \
  make env-rm
```

Create a new conda environment.

```bash
make env && \
  conda activate datalayer
```

## Install and Build

Install the JavaScript dependencies.

```bash
yarn
```

Build the JavaScript code.

```bash
yarn build
```

Install the Python package.

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
# Double check
pip list | grep manager
# jupyter_manager ...
```

Link the JupyterLab extension for development.

```bash
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
# Installing: .../jupyter_manager/labextension -> @datalayer/jupyter-manager
# Removing: .../labextensions/@datalayer/jupyter-manager
# Symlinking: .../labextensions/@datalayer/jupyter-manager -> .../jupyter_manager/labextension
```

Check the availability of your Jupyter extension.

```bash
jupyter labextension list
# JupyterLab v4.0.0
# .../share/jupyter/labextensions
#        jupyterlab_pygments v0.2.2 enabled  X (python, jupyterlab_pygments)
#        @datalayer/jupyter-manager v0.0.2 enabled  X
jupyter server extension list
# Package jupyter_manager took 0.0015s to import
#      jupyter_manager 0.0.2 OK
```

## JupyterHub

Start JupyterHub and the separated webapp.

```bash
yarn jupyterhub
```

Check that JupyterHub is working fine by launching a server.

1. Browse http://localhost:8000 and login with username ($USER being you operating system user) and any password.
2. This will launch a JupyterLab server, you can view the Jupyter Manager extension.
3. You can view the adminstration page on http://localhost:8000/hub/admin

While JupyterHub and your server is running, you can run Jupyter Manager is a separated application on http://localhost:3063.

In another terminal, you can connect to the JupyterHub local SQLite database an run queries.

```bash
# .schema
# .tables
# .schema api_tokens
# select * from api_tokens;
make sqlite
```

Inspect the configurable HTTP proxy routes.

```bash
# Use the Authorization token defined in c.ConfigurableHTTPProxy.auth_token = '0bc02bede919e99a26de1e2a7a5aadfaf6228de836ec39a05a6c6942831d8fe5'
curl \
  -H "Authorization: token 0bc02bede919e99a26de1e2a7a5aadfaf6228de836ec39a05a6c6942831d8fe5" \
  http://localhost:8001/api/routes | jq
# {
#   "/": {
#     "hub": true,
#     "target": "http://127.0.0.1:8081",
#     "jupyterhub": true,
#     "last_activity": "2023-05-07T10:51:55.714Z"
#   }
# }
```

## JupyterLab

Start JupyterLab and watch the sources.

```bash
echo open http://localhost:8686/api/jupyter/lab?token=60c1661cc408f978c309d04157af55c9588ff9557c9380e4fb50785750703da6
yarn jupyterlab
```

Alternatively, you can use 2 terminals. First start JupyterLab in terminal 1.

```bash
echo open http://localhost:8686/api/jupyter/lab?token=60c1661cc408f978c309d04157af55c9588ff9557c9380e4fb50785750703da6
jupyter lab --port 8686
```

Then, in terminal 2, watch for changes.

```bash
yarn watch
```

## Web Application

Start the Webpack and Jupyter servers.

```bash
echo open http://localhost:3063
echo open http://localhost:8686/api/jupyter?token=60c1661cc408f978c309d04157af55c9588ff9557c9380e4fb50785750703da6
yarn start
```

## Clean

Kill any remaining ghost processes.

```bash
yarn kill
```

To restart JupyterHub from zero, remove the SQLite database.

```bash
rm jupyterhub.sqlite
```
