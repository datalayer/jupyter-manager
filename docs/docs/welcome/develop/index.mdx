# Develop

Follow the below steps to develop `Jupyter Manager`.

## Environment

First, you need [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) up-and-running on your machine.

:::caution

You need to develop on macOS or Linux. Windows is not supported as development platform for the time-being.

:::

Clone the `jupyter-manager` repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-manager.git && \
  cd jupyter-manager
```

If you already have created a conda environment, please remove it.

```bash
conda deactivate && \
  make env-rm
```

Create a new conda environment.

```bash
make env && \
  conda activate datalayer
```

:::caution

JupyterLab has migrated to Yarn v3 which is not friendly with resolutions, especially for non final (alpha, beta, rc) releases. Ensure Yarn v1 for resolutions and Visual Studio Code completions.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/v4.0.0a36/jupyterlab/staging/yarn.js \
 -o $( dirname "$(which jupyter)" )/../lib/python3.11/site-packages/jupyterlab/staging/yarn.js
jlpm --version # Should be 1.22.19.
```

:::

## Install and Build

Install the JavaScript dependencies.

```bash
yarn
```

Build the JavaScript code.

```bash
yarn build
```

Install the Python package.

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
# Double check
pip list | grep manager
# jupyter_manager ...
```

Double check the jlpm version, as the pip command may have changed that.

```bash
# Should be 1.22.19.
jlpm --version
```

If it is not `1.22.19`, run again the following command.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/v4.0.0a36/jupyterlab/staging/yarn.js \
 -o $( dirname "$(which jupyter)" )/../lib/python3.11/site-packages/jupyterlab/staging/yarn.js
jlpm --version # Should be 1.22.19.
```

Link the JupyterLab extension for development.

```bash
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
# Installing: .../jupyter_manager/labextension -> @datalayer/jupyter-manager
# Removing: .../labextensions/@datalayer/jupyter-manager
# Symlinking: .../labextensions/@datalayer/jupyter-manager -> .../jupyter_manager/labextension
```

Check the availability of your Jupyter extension.

```bash
jupyter labextension list
# JupyterLab v4.0.0b1
# .../share/jupyter/labextensions
#        jupyterlab_pygments v0.2.2 enabled  X (python, jupyterlab_pygments)
#        @datalayer/jupyter-manager v0.0.2 enabled  X
jupyter server extension list
# Package jupyter_manager took 0.0015s to import
#      jupyter_manager 0.0.2 OK
```

## Web Application

Start the Webpack and Jupyter servers.

```bash
echo open http://localhost:3063
echo open http://localhost:8686/api/jupyter?token=60c1661cc408f978c309d04157af55c9588ff9557c9380e4fb50785750703da6
yarn start
```

## JupyterLab

Start JupyterLab and watch the sources.

```bash
echo open http://localhost:8686/api/jupyter/lab?token=60c1661cc408f978c309d04157af55c9588ff9557c9380e4fb50785750703da6
yarn jupyterlab
```

Alternatively, you can use 2 terminals. First start JupyterLab in terminal 1.

```bash
echo open http://localhost:8686/api/jupyter/lab?token=60c1661cc408f978c309d04157af55c9588ff9557c9380e4fb50785750703da6
jupyter lab --port 8686
```

Then, in terminal 2, watch for changes.

```bash
yarn watch
```

## JupyterHub

Start JupyterHub and the separated webapp.

```bash
yarn jupyterhub
```

Check that JupyterHub is working fine by launching a server.

1. Browse http://localhost:8000 and login with username ($USER being you operating system user) and any password.
2. This will launch a JupyterLab server, you can view the Jupyter Manager extension.
3. You can view the adminstration page on http://localhost:8000/hub/admin

While JupyterHub and your server is running, you can run Jupyter Manager is a separated application on http://localhost:3063.

In another terminal, you can connect to the JupyterHub local SQLite database an run queries.

```bash
# .schema
# .tables
# .schema api_tokens
# select * from api_tokens;
make sqlite
```

## Clean

Kill any remaining ghost processes.

```bash
yarn kill
```

To restart JupyterHub from zero, remove the SQLite database.

```bash
rm jupyterhub.sqlite
```
