# 🪐 🎛️ Jupyter Manager

> User interface to manage your Jupyter platform.

Jupyter Manager is a user interface to manage the Jupyter platform in a more visual way instead of relying to shell script of configuration files.

You can easily `configure`, `monitor` and `operate` your Jupyter platform.

## Deployments

`Jupyter Manager` can be deployed:

- As a JupyterLab extension, in that case it allows you the manage the local extensions deployed on that Jupyter Server instance.
- As a service on any JupyterHub, in that case it uses the JupyterHub REST API (see the [Swagger definition](http://petstore.swagger.io?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/main/docs/source/_static/rest-api.yml#/default)).
